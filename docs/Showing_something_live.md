# Showing something live

Now you should have a Schedule ready to use. Select the item you want to
display in the Order of Service and either press space bar on your
keyboard or click “Go Live” in the Preview section. There you navigate
through the slides by clicking the different text sections or by using
your keyboard’s up and down arrow keys. You can also use the Page Up and
the Page Down keys, which often is used by presentation remotes. Note,
however, that this will not work if the database panel is selected.
