# Recordings tab

## Path for recordings

Set the path where you want audio recordings to be stored.

## Automatically convert recordings to MP3 files (requires VLC)

Will automatically start converting a recording to a MP3 file once it is
done and delete the original recording file. If you are not in need of
any manual modification of the recording once it is done, the MP3 file
will be much smaller in size and better for distribution. If, however,
you want to edit the file in a separate software, for instance to adjust
sound levels or delete silence, the default WAV format is better. Note
that WAV files will be significantly larger. If VLC is not found, this
option will be disabled.
