# Remote App Troubleshooting

If you have problems connecting your device to the [Quelea server](https://quelea.org), there's a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that [the remote server is started in Quelea](Mobile_Remote) and that it finds a URL.
2. Make sure your phone is connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
3. Move closer to the router to ensure you have a good connection.
4. Try the URL in the web browser of your device. If that works, there might be an issue with the app that you need to [report here](https://github.com/ArvidNy/quelea-flutter-remote/issues).
5. Try changing the port number and restarting Quelea.
6. Try disabling the firewall of your computer temporarily. If that works you need to add an exception for Quelea (might also say Java, which is the platform Quelea is running on).
7. Try disabling the antivirus software of your computer temporarily. If that works you need to add an exception for Quelea (might also say Java, which is the platform Quelea is running on).
8. Ask a question in [the discussion group](https://quelea.discourse.group) and describe your setup and what you have attempted already.
