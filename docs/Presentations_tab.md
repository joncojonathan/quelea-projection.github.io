# Presentations tab

## Use OpenOffice for presentations (experimental)

Requires a separate installation of OpenOffice or LibreOffice and allows
you to get additional features for presentations, such as
animations/transitions and enfolded items. Note that this feature at the
moment only has experimental support and might contain occasional bugs.

## OpenOffice path

Locate the path where the installation of OpenOffice/LibreOffice is
located.

## Use PowerPoint for presentations

Requires a separate installation of PowerPoint and allows you to get
additional features for presentations, such as animations/transitions
and enfolded items. Note that this to some extent relies on PowerPoint’s
own controls (a separate window) and is handled a bit differently
depending on if your computer is a PC or a Mac.

## PowerPoint path

Locate the installation path of PowerPoint. Usually that is C:\\Program
Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office15\\POWERPNT.EXE where the number 15
might have to be swapped for the version number you might have.
