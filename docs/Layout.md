# Layout

One might say Quelea is divided into three sections: [Schedule and
Database](#schedule-and-database "Schedule and Database"),
[Preview](#preview "Preview") and [Live](#live "Live").

## Schedule and Database

Below you see the Order of Service and the Database, where all your
songs will be stored and can be organised for different occasion. The
first time you start Quelea you will need to [add
songs](Adding_items_to_Order_of_Service#adding-a-song "Adding items to Order of Service") to the
database. Once you have added songs to the database you can start
[organizing
them](Adding_items_to_Order_of_Service#organizing-a-schedule "Adding items to Order of Service")
in the Order of Service, or a Schedule as it also is called.

Below is an example of songs in a database and an Order of Service
(Schedule):

## Preview

The preview allows you to see what your items will look like before you
show them live. You can preview different slides by clicking the
different text sections or by using your keyboard’s up and down arrow
keys. When you are ready to show the item live, just click the “Go live”
button.

## Live

In the live section you can switch between the slides by clicking the
different text sections, by using your keyboard’s up and down arrow
keys, the Page Up and the Page Down keys or by using section shortcuts
(see [Shortcuts and other things that are good to
know](Shortcuts_and_other_things_that_are_good_to_know "Shortcuts and other things that are good to know")). If
you are not ready to show the text live just yet, you have three options
to hide the text: Logo button, Black Screen or Clear screen.

### Logo button

If you select the Logo button, the [logo you have
pre-assigned](Logo "Logo") will appear and any changes of slide or
item will not appear until you deselect the button.

### Black Screen

If you select the Black Screen button, the projector output will be
completely black, not displaying any changes of slide or item until you
deselect the button.

### Clear screen

If you select the Clear Screen button, any text will disappear and the
background image/video/colour you have pre-assigned will be the only
thing visible on the output (see [Themes](Themes "Themes")). Any
changes of slide or item will not appear until you deselect the button.
